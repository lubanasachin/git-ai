//! Token-usage worker: reads agent transcripts incrementally, aggregates
//! deduplicated token usage into 5-minute UTC buckets, and emits `TokenUsage`
//! metric events for buckets whose aggregate changed.
//!
//! Design notes:
//! - Everything runs off the trace2 ingestion path: work arrives as
//!   non-blocking notifications from the stream worker (after it processed a
//!   transcript), a 30-minute sweep ticker, and a startup sweep.
//! - Sweeps enumerate the streams database's `transcript` rows, so every
//!   session git-ai knows about is backfilled: a newly tracked file starts at
//!   byte offset 0 and its full history is bucketed on first processing.
//!   Sweep enumeration is cheap per session (one stat compared against the
//!   token database's size/mtime snapshot); per-file work — extractor state,
//!   repo discovery, reading — only happens for files that actually changed.
//! - Notifications and sweep backfill run on separate queues: the await
//!   drain barrier waits only for notification-driven work, so a first-start
//!   historical backfill can never starve `git-ai await`.
//! - The read cursor, extractor state, entries, and emission fingerprints all
//!   live in [`TokenUsageDatabase`]; each batch commits atomically, and
//!   emission reconciles fingerprints across all of the session's buckets, so
//!   there is no retry machinery here - a failed pass (or a crash at any
//!   point) is healed by the next notification or sweep, with a per-file
//!   error backoff so a permanently failing transcript is not re-read on
//!   every trigger. The size/mtime quiet-skip snapshot is written only after
//!   a fully successful pass.
//! - Usage is leaf-attributed: subagent/fork transcripts own their usage
//!   under their own session (like SessionEvents), carrying the parent as
//!   the parent_session_id/external_parent_session_id attributes. Entry
//!   dedup is global across sessions (resume/fork copies; sidechain replays
//!   of parent messages dedup against the parent's entries wherever they
//!   live); when a replacement moves an entry between sessions, the
//!   previous owner's files are invalidated so its buckets re-reconcile on
//!   the next pass with their own attributes.
//! - The `token_usage_metrics` feature flag gates the worker at daemon
//!   startup (like `transcript_streaming`); when it is off, the token-usage
//!   database is deleted so no collected data is retained.
//! - Sweep/backfill passes are CPU-throttled to a ~30% duty cycle of one
//!   core (each batch's work is followed by a proportional pause), so a
//!   large first-run backfill takes ~3x longer instead of pinning a core.
//!   Notification-driven passes are never throttled: they sit on the
//!   `git-ai await` drain barrier's post-commit critical path, and a task
//!   promoted from the sweep queue by a notification runs unthrottled too.
